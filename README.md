# Senior Frontend Engineer (Vue.js) E-Commerce Test Task Application for Lightspeed

## Overview

This application provides a complete e-commerce experience with category browsing, product discovery, and shopping cart functionality. It integrates with the Ecwid REST API to fetch real store data and implements best practices for Vue.js application development.

## Sliced File Architecture

This project follows the **Sliced File Architecture** pattern, where all files related to a specific feature are stored together in a single directory. This approach makes the code more understandable and maintainable.

```
src/
├── catalog/                  # Catalog page (home)
│   ├── categories/            # Categories feature
│   └── products/              # Products feature
├── cart/                     # Shopping cart page
│   └── components/            # Cart-specific components
